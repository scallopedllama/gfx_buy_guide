This script is used to compare the prices and passmark benchmarks of graphic cards for sale on kakaku.com in Japan.
The script could easily be modified to work with newegg for example but would require some modifications by somebody who knows how to work bash.
I've added some notes throughout to help you modify the script to your needs.

Usage is pretty simple. Just run it like so:
./gfx_buy_guide.sh [pages]
from the terminal replacing [pages] with the number of listing pages to parse. Note that the input is not checked for validity.
You must also have a mysql database configured called 'gpu' that you have full privilages on. See the MySQL documentation for help with that.
Run ./gfx_buy_guide.sh -h for help.

The script produces a file called card_data.tsv which is a tab-separated-value file that you can easily paste into any popular spreadsheet program.
That file contains the card name, GPU, price, Passmark rank, Passmark score, Ram type, Ram amount, and the outputs. That information (minus the passmark stuff)
is basically what kakaku.com puts on the page for graphics card listings.

I tried to make the script very understadable so that it's easily modifiable but unfortunately, you'd need to understand sed pretty well to make much of it.
